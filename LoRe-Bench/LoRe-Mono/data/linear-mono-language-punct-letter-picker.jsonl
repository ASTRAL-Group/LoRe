{"idx": 30, "type": "punctuation-guided-letter-picker", "task": "Punctuation-Guided Letter Picker\n\nYou are controlling a tiny cursor that walks around a circular strip of text. The strip never ends: when you step past the last character, you wrap around to the beginning.\n\nInputs for this instance:\n- text T (length 71): \"ab,cd.ef!gh?ij;kl:mn,op.qr!st?uv;wx:yz,ab.cd!ef?gh;ij:kl,mn.op!qr?st;uv\"\n- cursor start index i0 = 1 (ZERO-BASED: the very first character of T is at index 0)\n- maximum steps N = 30\n- target word length k = 20\n- modulus mod_num = 1000003\n- punctuation set P and jump table: ','→2, '.'→3, '!'→5, '?'→7, ';'→11, ':'→13\n\nHow to run the picker:\n1) Look at the character under the cursor i.\n   • If it is a letter (A–Z or a–z): append its LOWERCASE form to the end of buffer B, then move the cursor one position to the right (i ← i + 1, with wraparound).\n   • If it is punctuation in P: DO NOT collect anything. Instead, jump forward by jump(c) positions (i ← i + jump(c), with wraparound) and add jump(c) to a running integer score.\n2) Stop immediately as soon as the buffer length reaches k. If that never happens, stop after at most N steps.\n\nWhat to output:\n- If you stopped because the buffer reached k letters, output the last k letters of B as a lowercase word (in the order they were collected).\n- Otherwise, output the integer value (score mod mod_num).\n\nImportant details:\n- The cursor index is ZERO-BASED and starts at i0.\n- The tape is circular; all cursor moves wrap around len(T).\n- Treat letters case-insensitively; only A–Z/a–z are letters. All other characters in T are punctuation from P.\n- Do not try to “shortcut” by assuming periodic patterns; just follow the steps exactly.\n", "gt_ans": 117}
